1) write pointer to GOT of libc function into mem
2) leak value of libc function with a some kind of print (float value?)
	a) set point to matrix data as GOT of free()
	b) get first index => outputs a float of free()'s address at runtime
3) calculate location of system
4) put "/bin/sh" in memory
5) get some function replaced with address of system to run with "/bin/sh" as argument
